# GitHub Auto Backup – Simple, Reliable, and Automatic  

GitHub Auto Backup is a lightweight Windows application that automatically backs up your local repositories to GitHub. No more forgetting to push changes or losing progress—just set it up once, and it takes care of the rest.  

## Why Use GitHub Auto Backup?  
- Automates your backups so you never lose progress  
- Lets you schedule backups daily, weekly, or monthly  
- Works quietly in the background without interrupting your workflow  
- Provides one-click manual backups whenever you need them  
- Keeps logs of backup activity so you can track what’s happening  
- Won’t accidentally push to `main` or `master`, protecting your production branches  

## How It Works  
1. Install the app and select the folder where your repositories are stored  
2. Set your preferred backup interval (daily, weekly, or monthly)  
3. Choose a time for the backup to run  
4. Let the app handle everything automatically  
5. Need a quick backup? Click “Run Backup Now” anytime  

## System Requirements  
- Windows 10 or later  
- .NET 8.0 runtime (available from Microsoft)  
- 8GB RAM, 1.6 GHz processor, 100MB disk space  

## Installation  
1. Download the installer (`Github Auto Backup Setup.exe`)  
2. Run the setup and follow the prompts  
3. Launch the app, select your repo folder, and configure your backup settings  
4. The app will now run in the background, keeping your code backed up  

## How to Use  
- Select your local repository folder  
- Set a backup interval and preferred backup time  
- Click "Run Backup Now" for an immediate push  
- Access logs to check backup history  
- Use the system tray icon for quick access and controls  

## What It Won’t Do  
- Won’t push changes to `main` or `master`  
- Won’t interfere with your workflow—runs quietly in the background  
- Won’t upload unintended changes—keeps your repositories under control
